# Glucose Pumps Specification
The Glucose Pumps addon for Odoo 18 enables tracking of glucose pump devices across their lifecycle - from available stock through patient assignment to eventual scrapping. Devices can be assigned as either primary or holiday pump (backup for travel), with full assignment history including installation and replacement dates. 

A central dashboard shows device counts by status with quick actions for unassignment and scrapping. Automated alerts flag devices approaching replacement. Chatter integration logs all state changes on both device and patient records.
